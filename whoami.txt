* Good Afternoon Everyone

# My name is Arnaldo and I made a presentation to let you guys know a little 
# about myself.

# We're all familiar with a terminal so you're gona help me navigate through mine.

# I love technology. Ever since I was a child I've had this natural curiosity to tinker around with
# every single device I'd get my hands on.

# Progress, Money, Peace. Wow I guess we all know how it is to feel stuck. Therefore, I've really come to value
# these 3 things.

# And well... I'm well aware I exist. That comes at a price and it ain't alway cheap. Might include sacrifices.
# So... might as well enjoy it.

# Hobbbiieeeeee

# I'm always on the internet. I understand we can say we're all basically connected now a days some way or another.
# I play video games, rarely, but I do. My favorite console would be the gamecube and my favorite game >
# The Thousand-Year Door. 
# I'm very into ROM hacks as well. I grew up wiht Pokemon, and ROM hacks enabled unlimited posibilities.
# But it doesn't stop there, the ROM hacking and modding scene have brought us FAN Translations giving us the 
# oportunity to play region exclusive games.
# I also remember the old days of Minecraft Java, before bedrock existed and the Pixelmon Mod.
# My favorite game at the moment... I guess it's World of Warcraft.
# Note I don't pay for anything so I'm very use to tweaking and fiding ways to get things to work.

# Music:
# Very broad, not limited to a single genre. I can dance too.
# *LAUGH*
# Cardgames
# Yugioh, Pokemon, Magic, Hearthstone.. You name it. Recently got introduced to Star Wars Unlimited and
# I really enjoy a good game Blackjack.
# Podcasts yeah, the most recent would be Darknet Diares by Jack Rhysider it's great you should check it out.
# Whatever comes forward, I can try new things.

# Why Holberton?
# Fast & Efficient, I understand that's why most of us are here. Money and time are very important factors for
# me and 9 months sounds nice.
# Project-based Learning, basically the only way I can learn.
# Real interactions. This, what we're doing right now.
# Commitment. Yes I can find my own resources and do my own independent study but I feel like being part
# of something will broaden my options.
